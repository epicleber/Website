description: Hi! I'm Cleber Vinicius Brito dos Santos. I'm a second-year doctorate student in Epidemiology at the [Instituto de Medicina Social](https://https://www.ims.uerj.br) at the [State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)](https://www.uerj.br), under the joint supervision of [Cláudio José Struchiner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kVh9mCwAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao) and [Guilherme Loureiro Werneck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UK-Di5gAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao). 
My main interest interests lie in infectious disease dynamics and their determinants, specially zoonosis, vector-borne and air-borne diseases.
