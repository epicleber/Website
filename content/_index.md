description:  Hi! I'm Cleber Vinicius Brito dos Santos. I’m a Post-doctoral research associate at the [Ko Lab](https://ko-laboratory.github.io/site/) at the Yale School of Public Health under [Albert Ko’s](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mdSJ75MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) supervision. Currently, we are interested in (1) evaluating the effectiveness of the deployment of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in reducing the incidence of dengue identified by passive public health surveillance in Belo Horizonte (Brazil); and (2) estimating the spatiotemporal clustering of arboviral cases in Belo Horizonte.

I hold an MSc and a PhD in Epidemiology at the [Instituto de Medicina Social](https://www.ims.uerj.br) at the [State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)](https://www.uerj.br), under the joint supervision of [Cláudio José Struchiner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kVh9mCwAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao) and [Guilherme Loureiro Werneck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UK-Di5gAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao). My main interest lies in infectious disease dynamics and their determinants, especially zoonosis, vector-borne and air-borne diseases.
